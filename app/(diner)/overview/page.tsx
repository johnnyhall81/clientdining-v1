        For Restaurants and Private Members’ Clubs
      </h1>

      <p>
        ClientDining is a private booking platform for early evening business
        dining during the working week.
      </p>

      <p>
        It works with a small group of leading restaurants and private members’
        clubs where early weekday tables are quieter than later services. These
        periods are not empty, but they are underused, and rarely something
        venues wish to address through promotion or discounting.
      </p>

      <p>
        ClientDining introduces verified City professionals hosting low key
        business dinners. These are straightforward bookings: one table,
        discreet service, good spend, and a clean finish.
      </p>

      <p>
        Venues share availability directly with the platform and retain full
        control throughout. You decide what to offer, when to offer it, and
        which requests to accept. Bookings are reviewed and confirmed directly
        by the venue. Nothing changes operationally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Participation is flexible and can be adjusted or paused at any time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some venues also use ClientDining selectively for private rooms,
        particularly for corporate breakfasts or lunches.
      </p>

      <p>
        Commercially, ClientDining operates on a flat commission on completed
        bookings, calculated on food and beverage spend excluding VAT and
        service charge, and invoiced monthly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The venue group is kept deliberately small and peer level. Growth is
        controlled so demand concentrates and standards remain high.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this is relevant, a short walkthrough is usually enough to determine
        fit.
