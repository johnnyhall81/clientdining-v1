            Across London, many venues see the same pattern. Early evenings from Monday to Friday
            are calmer than they should be. Not empty. Not broken. Simply underused. And not a
            period most restaurants or clubs want to push with promotions or noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, the way City professionals host has changed. What was once drinks
            after work, dinner, and on to a club is now more often a considered dinner at 6:00 or
            6:30, followed by an early finish. The intent remains, but the rhythm is different.
          </p>
          <p>
            ClientDining is built around that shift.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our members are senior City professionals hosting low-key business dinners. One table.
            Discreet service. Good spend. Finished smoothly. They value certainty, and they book
            accordingly.

            Venues share availability directly with the platform and retain full control
            throughout. Nothing changes operationally. You decide what to offer, when to offer it,
            and who you accept.

            Some venues also use ClientDining selectively to make better use of private rooms,
            particularly for small corporate breakfast or lunch roundtables.
          </p>
          <p>
            These bookings sit comfortably alongside existing operations.

            Commercially, the model is simple. ClientDining earns a flat commission on completed
            bookings, calculated on food and beverage spend exclusive of VAT and service charge,
            invoiced monthly.

            ClientDining grows deliberately. The venue group is kept small and peer-level so demand
            concentrates and standards stay high.

            If this sounds relevant, a short walkthrough is usually enough to see whether it fits.
